## Description
This GitHub repository serves as my university coursework project on 2D fluid simulation. The project focuses on the implementation of a 2D fluid simulation using physics-based forces applied to particles, simulating the behavior of water. The entire codebase has been independently developed, encompassing various algorithms and techniques for an accurate representation of fluid dynamics.
